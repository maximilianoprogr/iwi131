00:00:00,387 --> 00:00:03,562
Previously on AMC's The Walking Dead...

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:05,323
What is this place?

3
00:00:05,458 --> 00:00:07,992
This is the start of sustainability, community.

4
00:00:08,127 --> 00:00:10,461
Rick, his group... they're dangerous.

5
00:00:11,631 --> 00:00:12,997
Noah died because of you.

6
00:00:13,132 --> 00:00:14,999
You tried to kill me.

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,340
Why?

8
00:00:22,475 --> 00:00:23,556
Cause all life is precious.

9
00:00:25,144 --> 00:00:26,344
Do it.

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,146
Rick?

11
00:00:37,824 --> 00:00:39,323
<i>Rick?</i>

12
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,728
<i>I know this sounds insane,</i>

13
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,130
<i>but this is an insane world.</i>

14
00:00:46,132 --> 00:00:49,467
<i>We have to come for them before they come for us.</i>

15
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:52,403
<i>It's that simple.</i>

16
00:00:52,405 --> 00:00:55,423
This is where it all starts tomorrow.
